Here’s a draft of a **README file** that covers both **Task 1** (fine-tuning TTS for English technical vocabulary) and **Task 2** (fine-tuning TTS for a regional language). This will help guide anyone reviewing your project.

# **Fine-Tuning Text-to-Speech Models for Technical Vocabulary and a Regional Language**

## **Project Overview**

This project involves fine-tuning two Text-to-Speech (TTS) models:
1. **English TTS Model** with a focus on technical vocabulary (e.g., "API," "CUDA," "OAuth," etc.).
2. **Regional Language TTS Model** aimed at synthesizing high-quality speech for a selected regional language.

The objective is to improve the pronunciation of technical terms for the English model and enhance the naturalness and intelligibility of speech in the regional language. The project includes model selection, dataset collection, fine-tuning, and evaluation.

## **Tasks Breakdown**

### **Task 1: Fine-tuning TTS for English with Technical Vocabulary**

#### **1. Model Selection**
For this task, the **SpeechT5** model was selected for fine-tuning due to its multi-speaker support and flexibility in handling technical terms. The model is adapted to improve the pronunciation of terms frequently used in technical interviews.

#### **2. Dataset Collection**
The dataset includes:
- General English sentences.
- Technical terms like "API," "CUDA," "TTS," "OAuth," and "REST."

Sources for this dataset:
- **Interview transcripts**: Real or synthesized transcripts focusing on technical vocabulary.
- **Technical blog posts**: Extracted sentences with technical jargon.
  
The dataset is stored in `data/english_dataset/`.

#### **3. Fine-tuning**
- The fine-tuning process was carried out using the **Hugging Face Trainer** API.
- The phonetic representations were adjusted to ensure accurate pronunciation of abbreviations.
- Hyperparameters like **learning rate** and **batch size** were carefully chosen to avoid overfitting.

#### **4. Evaluation**
- **MOS (Mean Opinion Score)** was used to evaluate the quality of synthesized speech, especially for technical terms.
- The model was benchmarked against the **Mozilla TTS** model on the pronunciation of technical terms.
- Audio samples and evaluation logs are available in the `audio_samples/english/` and `logs/` directories.

### **Task 2: Fine-tuning TTS for a Regional Language**

#### **1. Model Selection**
The **Coqui TTS** model was selected for fine-tuning the regional language, due to its support for multi-language TTS and flexible fine-tuning capabilities.

#### **2. Dataset Collection**
The dataset consists of natural language sentences in the selected regional language. It was sourced from:
- **VoxPopuli** or **CommonVoice** datasets, covering a wide range of phonemes and speaker diversity.
- Custom recordings for specific phonetic and prosodic challenges.

The dataset is stored in `data/regional_language_dataset/`.

#### **3. Fine-tuning**
- Fine-tuning was performed to adjust pronunciation, prosody, and stress patterns in accordance with the phonological rules of the language.
- Focus was placed on preventing overfitting to a specific speaker by ensuring speaker diversity in the dataset.

#### **4. Evaluation**
- Subjective evaluations were conducted with **native speakers** of the regional language to assess the naturalness and intelligibility of the synthesized speech.
- Objective metrics like **MOS** were used to assess overall quality.
- Benchmarks were performed against other pre-trained models (if available).
- Audio samples and evaluation logs are stored in `audio_samples/regional_language/` and `logs/`.

## **How to Run**

### **1. Fine-Tuning**
To fine-tune either the English TTS or the regional language TTS model, use the following command:
```bash
python fine_tuning_script.py --task [english|regional_language] --dataset_path path_to_dataset --model_output_path path_to_save_model
```
- Replace `[english|regional_language]` with the desired task.
- Replace `path_to_dataset` with the path to the dataset.
- Replace `path_to_save_model` with the directory where the fine-tuned model will be saved.

### **2. Evaluation**
To evaluate the fine-tuned models:
```bash
python evaluation_script.py --task [english|regional_language] --model_path path_to_model --test_dataset_path path_to_test_dataset
```
- Replace `[english|regional_language]` with the desired task.
- Replace `path_to_model` with the path to the model being evaluated.
- Replace `path_to_test_dataset` with the path to the test dataset.

The evaluation results, including MOS scores and audio samples, will be saved in the `logs/` directory.

## **Deliverables**
1. Fine-tuned models (stored in `models/`).
2. Training logs (stored in `logs/`).
3. Audio samples for both English and regional language (stored in `audio_samples/`).
4. Technical terms and correct pronunciation for Task 1 (included in the report).
5. Detailed evaluation report for both tasks, including MOS scores, pronunciation accuracy, and benchmarks.
